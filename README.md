## Project-Objectives
“FarmApp.” is a comprehensive mobile application that provides many benefits to its users in both personal home planning and agricultural fields. While it supports plants to stay healthy and vibrant, it helps us keep track of the irrigation times and growing periods of the plants by providing irrigation and growing calendars. It also aims to help farmers by including a map indicating the location of clean water resources.

When you sign in to your email address, you will be directed to the home page of the application. There are three main categories on the home page: Flowers, Vegetables-Fruits and Trees. By selecting any of these categories, you can access the content of the relevant category. In the 'My Plants' section you can see all the plants you have added so far. When you click on each plant, you will be directed to detailed information and calendar pages where you can get more information. You'll also find the 'Recommended For You' section at the bottom of the page, organized based on the plants you've added so far. When you select the flower category, you can see hundreds of flowers in our application in order. When you click on the flower you are interested in, you will be directed to a page with detailed information about the flower. If you want to save the flower, you can add it to the 'My Plants' section by clicking the + sign. You can quickly find the flower you want to add by using the search bar at the top of the page. This page, which we visit to get detailed information about the relevant plant, contains all the necessary basic information. Many needs of the plant, such as water, light, soil and temperature, are mentioned here. Users can easily solve most of their questions by reviewing this page. In the Calendar tab, we determine the planting date and create a calendar accordingly. A sign symbolizing the October date is placed on that day. The irrigation schedule starts from the planting date and indicates which day to water a drop of water. The user can keep track of how much the plant will grow and when it will grow.
